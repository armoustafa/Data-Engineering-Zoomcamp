-- Create an external table
CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE `vigilant-cider-447718-n5.taxi_trips.external_yellow_tripdata`
OPTIONS (
  format = 'PARQUET',
  uris = ['gs://ata_clean/yellow_tripdata_2024-*.parquet']
);

-- Create a non partitioned table from external table
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE vigilant-cider-447718-n5.taxi_trips.yellow_tripdata_non_partitioned AS
SELECT * FROM vigilant-cider-447718-n5.taxi_trips.external_yellow_tripdata;



-- Question 1: What is count of records for the 2024 Yellow Taxi Data?, The answer: 20332093
SELECT COUNT(1) FROM `vigilant-cider-447718-n5.taxi_trips.yellow_tripdata_non_partitioned` 

-- Question 2: Write a query to count the distinct number of PULocationIDs for the entire dataset on both the tables. 
-- What is the estimated amount of data that will be read when this query is executed on the External Table and the Table?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT PULocationID) 
FROM `vigilant-cider-447718-n5.taxi_trips.external_yellow_tripdata`;
-- This query will process 0 B when run.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT PULocationID) 
FROM `vigilant-cider-447718-n5.taxi_trips.yellow_tripdata_non_partitioned`;
-- This query will process 155.12 MB when run.


-- Question 3: Write a query to retrieve the PULocationID from the table (not the external table) in BigQuery. 
-- Now write a query to retrieve the PULocationID and DOLocationID on the same table. Why are the estimated number of Bytes different?
SELECT PULocationID FROM `vigilant-cider-447718-n5.taxi_trips.yellow_tripdata_non_partitioned`;
-- This query will process 155.12 MB when run.
SELECT PULocationID, DOLocationID FROM `vigilant-cider-447718-n5.taxi_trips.yellow_tripdata_non_partitioned`;
-- This query will process 310.24 MB when run.
-- BigQuery is a columnar database, and it only scans the specific columns requested in the query. Querying two columns (PULocationID, DOLocationID) requires reading more data than querying one column (PULocationID), leading to a higher estimated number of bytes processed.


-- Question 4: How many records have a fare_amount of 0? The answer: 8333
SELECT COUNT(1) 
FROM `vigilant-cider-447718-n5.taxi_trips.yellow_tripdata_non_partitioned` 
WHERE fare_amount = 0;

-- Question 5: What is the best strategy to make an optimized table in Big Query if your query will always filter based on tpep_dropoff_datetime and order the results by VendorID
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE `vigilant-cider-447718-n5.taxi_trips.yellow_tripdata_partitioned_clustered` 
PARTITION BY DATE(tpep_dropoff_datetime)
CLUSTER BY VendorID AS
(SELECT * FROM `vigilant-cider-447718-n5.taxi_trips.yellow_tripdata_non_partitioned`);
-- Partition by tpep_dropoff_datetime and Cluster on VendorID
-- Partitioning by Time: Time-based queries (like aggregating rides per day or filtering by a specific time range) can be processed more efficiently with partitioning, since only relevant time slices are read.
-- Clustering by Vendor: Once the relevant time-based partitions are identified, clustering by VendorID ensures that the system efficiently handles operations and queries that are vendor-specific.


-- Question 6: Write a query to retrieve the distinct VendorIDs between tpep_dropoff_datetime 2024-03-01 and 2024-03-15
-- Use the materialized table you created earlier in your from clause and note the estimated bytes. Now change the table in the from clause to the partitioned table you created for question 5 and note the estimated bytes processed. What are these values?
SELECT DISTINCT VendorID 
FROM `vigilant-cider-447718-n5.taxi_trips.yellow_tripdata_non_partitioned`
WHERE tpep_dropoff_datetime BETWEEN  '2024-03-01' and '2024-03-15';
-- This query will process 310.24 MB when run.
SELECT DISTINCT VendorID 
FROM `vigilant-cider-447718-n5.taxi_trips.yellow_tripdata_partitioned_clustered`
WHERE tpep_dropoff_datetime BETWEEN  '2024-03-01' and '2024-03-15';
-- This query will process 26.84 MB when run.
-- Answer: 310.24 MB for non-partitioned table and 26.84 MB for the partitioned table


-- Question 7: Where is the data stored in the External Table you created?
-- Answer is GCP Bucket
-- External Table in BigQuery refers to a table that does not store data inside BigQuery but instead references data stored externally.


-- Question 8: It is best practice in Big Query to always cluster your data: False 
-- We only use it when it improves performance


-- Question 9: Write a SELECT count(*) query FROM the materialized table you created. How many bytes does it estimate will be read? Why?
SELECT count(*) 
FROM `vigilant-cider-447718-n5.taxi_trips.yellow_tripdata_partitioned_clustered`;
-- This query will process 0 B when run.
-- BigQuery might only perform metadata checks, which doesnâ€™t require reading the actual data, resulting in zero bytes processed.
